# Overview

Compared with previous network-based methods that use unweighted DTI networks, wSDTNBI uses weighted DTI networks whose edge weights are correlated with binding affinities. A two-pronged approach based on weighted DTI and drugâ€“substructure association networks was employed to calculate prediction scores.

# Repo Contents
In this study, the algorithm is compiled in C language according to the principle of the wSDTNBI method, and the software is shown in netinfer.
The versions of software are, specifically:
```
CUDA=11.7 OR 10.2
